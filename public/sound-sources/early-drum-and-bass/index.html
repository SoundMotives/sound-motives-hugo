  <h1>Early Drum &amp; Bass</h1>
  <p>Arriving at university in Nottingham, Max was introduced to drum &amp; bass at the legendary <strong>Marcus Garvey Centre</strong>. It was his first experience of the genre in a club context.</p>
<p>Artists such as <strong>Mickey Finn</strong> and <strong>Aphrodite</strong>, along with labels like <strong>RAM Records</strong>, retained some of the aesthetic qualities Max loved in rave culture while introducing a new level of rhythmic complexity.</p>
<p>Acts such as <strong>Ed Rush &amp; Optical</strong> became particularly influential during this period.</p>

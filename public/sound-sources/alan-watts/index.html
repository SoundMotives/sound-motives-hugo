  <h1>Alan Watts</h1>
  <p>Alan Watts (1915–1973) was one of the first writers and speakers to interpret Eastern philosophy for Western audiences.</p>
<p>Born near London, Watts discovered Buddhism at a young age before moving to the United States in 1938. He later became an Episcopal priest, relocated to Millbrook, New York, and authored <em>The Wisdom of Insecurity</em>, one of his most influential works.</p>
<p>From the 1950s onward, his radio talks and lectures gained national reach, and by the 1960s he had become an unlikely spiritual voice for the counterculture movement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West.”
— <em>LA Times</em></p>
</blockquote>

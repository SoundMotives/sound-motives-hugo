  <h1>Reason</h1>
  <p>After leaving college and moving to London, Shigeto developed tendonitis, preventing him from playing drums for several months. The injury led to a period of depression, but also marked a turning point.</p>
<p>Encouraged by his brother, he began experimenting with music production instead of performance. Working with sequencers — particularly <strong>Reason</strong> — opened up an entirely new creative pathway, ultimately leading to his debut <em>New Crossings</em> EP in 2008.</p>
<p>This shift from physical performance to digital production reshaped Shigeto’s relationship with music and laid the foundation for his later work.</p>

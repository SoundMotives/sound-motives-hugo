  <h1>Dabrye — One:Three</h1>
  <p>While in high school, Shigeto discovered electronic music through his local label <strong>Ghostly International</strong>, which exposed him to a wide range of experimental and left-field releases.</p>
<p>Key records from this period included albums by <strong>Matthew Dear</strong>, <strong>Lusine</strong>, <strong>Midwest Product</strong>, and <strong>Charles Manier</strong>, but the defining moment came with <strong>Dabrye’s <em>One:Three</em></strong>, released by Ghostly in June 2001.</p>
<p>The record bridged Shigeto’s jazz background with a new electronic sensibility, opening his ears to rhythm, texture, and production as compositional tools.</p>

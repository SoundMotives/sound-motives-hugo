  <h1>Mo Kolours</h1>
  <p>Paul has long shared an affinity with the South London label <strong>22a</strong>, and for good reason — he has been close friends with members of the collective for over a decade.</p>
<p>One of those artists is <strong>Joe ‘Mo Kolours’</strong>, whose work Paul has greatly admired. Over the years, both producers have encouraged and motivated each other creatively, developing parallel approaches rooted in groove, texture, and intuition.</p>

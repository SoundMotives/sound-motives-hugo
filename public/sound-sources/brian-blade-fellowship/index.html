  <h1>Brian Blade — Fellowship</h1>
  <p>Shigeto moved east to attend college at <strong>The New School</strong> in New York, where he continued developing as a jazz drummer.</p>
<p>During this time, one of his biggest influences was <strong>Brian Blade</strong>, particularly Blade’s 1998 album <em>Fellowship</em> and the track <em>Folklore</em>. Blade’s expressive, musical approach to drumming — prioritising feel, restraint, and emotional communication — had a profound impact on Shigeto’s playing.</p>
<p>Brian Blade continues to lead the Fellowship while also collaborating with artists such as <strong>Joni Mitchell</strong>, <strong>Bob Dylan</strong>, and <strong>Wayne Shorter</strong>.</p>

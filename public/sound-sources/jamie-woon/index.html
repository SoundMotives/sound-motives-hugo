  <h1>Jamie Woon</h1>
  <p>Earlier in his career, Paul’s creative process was largely solitary — producing beats remotely for MCs. More recently, he began collaborating directly with musicians in shared studio spaces.</p>
<p>One of those early face-to-face collaborations was with <strong>Jamie Woon</strong> on the track <em>Thunder</em> from Woon’s 2015 album <em>Making Time</em>.</p>
<p>These sessions helped Paul develop new approaches to songwriting, lyrics, and collective creativity, highlighting the power of working closely with others.</p>

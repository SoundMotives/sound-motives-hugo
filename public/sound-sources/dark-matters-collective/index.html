  <h1>Dark Matters Collective</h1>
  <p><strong>Dark Matters</strong> are a visual collective who collaborated closely with Kenton Slash Demon on the <em>Schwarzschild Trilogy</em> of EPs.</p>
<p>As referenced in Episode 3, both the graphic designers and videographers involved in the project played a formative role in shaping the direction of the music itself, not merely its presentation.</p>
<p>Dark Matters have since worked with artists such as <strong>Den Sorte Skole</strong> and <strong>Trentemøller</strong>, often focusing on light projection and installation work — meaning that visuals which appear digitally generated are frequently physical, real-world constructions.</p>

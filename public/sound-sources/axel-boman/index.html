  <h1>Axel Boman</h1>
  <p><strong>Axel Boman</strong> is a Swedish electronic music producer whose remixes of Kenton Slash Demon’s <em>Daemon</em> in 2010 proved particularly influential.</p>
<p>Both remixes were sparse, evolving, and hypnotic, showcasing Boman’s ability to create tension and movement with minimal elements. While known for club-ready releases, it is his more experimental work that most strongly resonated with Kenton Slash Demon.</p>
<p>Recent remixes for <strong>John Talabot</strong> and <strong>Maribou State</strong>, as well as his original work on <strong>DJ Koze’s Pampa Records</strong>, continue to expand his sonic palette.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2014, I got to meet drummer, producer, and Ghostly International recording artist, Zach ‘Shigeto’ Saginaw. Zac was in the UK as part of a European tour, and in Episode 1, we hear about Shigeto’s hometown of Ann Arbor, and his experiences growing up near Detroit. He talks about his musical beginnings, the challenges involved in performing live as an electronic artist, and the dangers of getting sick of your own work. These discussions are framed around ‘Sound Sources’ from Shigeto’s upbringing; tracks and influences which have shaped his musical journey so far, alongside productions of his own.</p>

<p>Growing up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has had a significant influence on Zach’s output. As well as appearing in the titles of a number of his productions, the landscapes of his hometown frequently feature on his beautiful Instagram.</p>

<p>As a youngster growing up in Michigan, Zach Shigeto dreamt of being a professional jazz musician, and the albums listed below played a significant role in his early musical education:</p>
<p>Pharaoh Sanders – The Creator Has A Master Plan
Miles Davis – Four &amp; More Live In Concert 1964
Louis Smith – Here Comes Louis Smith
Bill Evans – Waltz For Debbie
Herbie Hancock – Empyrean Isles
John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme was recorded in late 1964 and released on Impulse! Recordings in 1965.</p>

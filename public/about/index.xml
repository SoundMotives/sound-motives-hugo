      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sound Motives is a long-form audio series exploring the musical influences that shape today’s most interesting artists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on releases or career milestones, each episode traces the deeper listening habits that sit behind an artist’s work — the records, scenes, sounds, and moments that helped form their creative perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guests are invited to reflect on the music that mattered to them at different points in their lives: formative records, pivotal cultural movements, and the sounds that continue to inform how they make music today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

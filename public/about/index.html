    <p>Sound Motives is a long-form audio series exploring the musical influences that shape today’s most interesting artists.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on releases or career milestones, each episode traces the deeper listening habits that sit behind an artist’s work — the records, scenes, sounds, and moments that helped form their creative perspective.</p>
<p>Guests are invited to reflect on the music that mattered to them at different points in their lives: formative records, pivotal cultural movements, and the sounds that continue to inform how they make music today.</p>
<p>Episodes move freely between genres and eras — from jazz and classical to jungle, dubstep, ambient, and electronic music — with an emphasis on curiosity, context, and personal storytelling.</p>
<p>Sound Motives is about listening more closely: to music, to process, and to the often unseen influences that connect artists across generations.</p>

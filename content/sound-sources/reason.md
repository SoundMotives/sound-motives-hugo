After leaving college and moving to London, Shigeto developed tendonitis, preventing him from playing drums for several months. The injury led to a period of depression, but also marked a turning point.

Encouraged by his brother, he began experimenting with music production instead of performance. Working with sequencers — particularly **Reason** — opened up an entirely new creative pathway, ultimately leading to his debut *New Crossings* EP in 2008.

This shift from physical performance to digital production reshaped Shigeto’s relationship with music and laid the foundation for his later work.

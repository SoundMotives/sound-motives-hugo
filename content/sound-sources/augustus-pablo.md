In his teens, Mala discovered the music of **Augustus Pablo**, the Jamaican melodica player and producer. Pablo’s subtle melodic flourishes and experimental approach to production deeply influenced Mala’s work.

Pablo’s innovations included early dub production, collaborations with **King Tubby** and **Lee “Scratch” Perry**, and the integration of drum machines with organic instrumentation.

Born Horace Swaby in 1954, Pablo’s career spanned from the mid-70s until his death in 1999, with the late 70s period widely regarded as his finest.

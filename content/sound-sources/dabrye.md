While in high school, Shigeto discovered electronic music through his local label **Ghostly International**, which exposed him to a wide range of experimental and left-field releases.

Key records from this period included albums by **Matthew Dear**, **Lusine**, **Midwest Product**, and **Charles Manier**, but the defining moment came with **Dabrye’s *One:Three***, released by Ghostly in June 2001.

The record bridged Shigeto’s jazz background with a new electronic sensibility, opening his ears to rhythm, texture, and production as compositional tools.

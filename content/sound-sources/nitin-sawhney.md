**Nitin Sawhney** provided a contrasting perspective to Mala’s dancefloor-focused approach. Albums like *Beyond Skin* and *Prophesy* highlighted classical and electronic influences, blending Indian musical training with contemporary production.

Sawhney’s multi-disciplinary approach — encompassing DJing, production, composition for film, TV, and symphony orchestras — offered Mala a model of versatility within a musical career.

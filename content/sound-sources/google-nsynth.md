Technology plays a significant role in Max’s musical process, from experiments with binaural sound and Dolby Atmos to emerging approaches such as machine learning.

**NSynth**, developed by Google, uses deep neural networks to generate sound at the level of individual samples. By analysing existing sounds and extracting their defining features, NSynth can interpolate between them to create entirely new timbres.

For Max, NSynth represents a future where advanced sound design tools become widely accessible, opening new creative possibilities for artists beyond traditional synthesis methods.

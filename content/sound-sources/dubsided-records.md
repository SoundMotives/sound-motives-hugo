For Kenton Slash Demon’s first EP on Tartelet Records in 2009, the group were heavily influenced by the percussive sounds of UK label **Dubsided**.

Run by producer **Dave Taylor**, releasing under the aliases **Switch** and **Solid Groove**, Dubsided played a major role in reshaping house music in the late 2000s. The label helped popularise the playful, rhythm-driven sub-genre often referred to as *fidget house*.

Dubsided released music from **Jesse Rose**, **Sinden**, **Hervé**, **Trevor Loveys**, and early **Duke Dumont**, leaving a lasting imprint on UK club culture.

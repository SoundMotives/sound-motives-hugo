Max describes **Philip Glass** as a major influence, particularly through his soundtrack work for *Koyaanisqatsi* (1982), an experimental film that combines music and visuals without traditional narrative.

Experiencing *Koyaanisqatsi* was the first time Max fully felt the power of combining sound and image to create a heightened emotional experience. The repeating motifs and evolving intensity of Glass’s score, paired with Ron Fricke’s cinematography, revealed how multiple mediums could reinforce one another.

The film’s director, Godfrey Reggio, spent six years developing the project on a small budget, travelling across the US to capture natural and urban environments — a process-driven approach that resonated deeply with Max’s own creative philosophy.

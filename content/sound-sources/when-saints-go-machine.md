In 2007, Kenton Slash Demon joined forces with **Simon Muschinsky** and **Nikolaj Manuel Vonsild** to form the electro-pop band **When Saints Go Machine**.

Their later album *Infinity Pool* blends electronic pop with emotional songwriting, drawing comparisons to **Tears for Fears** and **Kanye West’s* 808s & Heartbreak***, and features a guest appearance from **Killer Mike**.

Their performance at Roskilde Festival in 2013 marked a homecoming moment, with the festival having played an important role in their musical development.

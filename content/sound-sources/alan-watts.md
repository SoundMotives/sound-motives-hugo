Alan Watts (1915–1973) was one of the first writers and speakers to interpret Eastern philosophy for Western audiences.

Born near London, Watts discovered Buddhism at a young age before moving to the United States in 1938. He later became an Episcopal priest, relocated to Millbrook, New York, and authored *The Wisdom of Insecurity*, one of his most influential works.

From the 1950s onward, his radio talks and lectures gained national reach, and by the 1960s he had become an unlikely spiritual voice for the counterculture movement.

> “Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West.”

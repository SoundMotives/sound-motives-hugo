A recent collaboration Paul has enjoyed is with rising artist **Obongjayar** on the track *Adjacent Heart*.

Born in Nigeria, Steven Umoh grew up immersed in American hip-hop before moving to the UK, where he began questioning the authenticity of his adopted accent and persona. At university, he realised that embracing his natural Nigerian voice led him toward singing rather than rapping.

Now recording as Obongjayar, his sound blends spoken word, electronic music, Afrobeat, and soul — resisting easy categorisation while remaining deeply personal.

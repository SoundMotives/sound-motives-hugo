Growing up with ambitions to be a skateboard photographer, Paul initially discovered a lot of music through a monthly skateboarding video magazine called **411VM**. Launched in 1993, 411VM profiled skateboarders from the US and across the world, with the skaters choosing the music for their video sections.

Because it reflected the breadth of global skateboard culture rather than specific scenes or brands, the range of music was unusually broad and formative.

411VM ceased publication in 2004 as file-sharing and online video disrupted physical media. With the arrival of YouTube in 2005, its model quickly felt archaic — but for over a decade, 411VM sat at the heart of global skateboard culture.

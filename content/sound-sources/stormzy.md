Looking to the future, Mala acknowledges the next generation of UK artists, particularly **Stormzy**, a grime MC from South London/Croydon.

Stormzy’s self-released freestyles and tracks, including becoming the first unsigned MC to perform on *Jools Holland*, demonstrate the possibilities of innovation, longevity, and cultural reinvention — qualities Mala values in emerging artists.

An eclectic mix of music was always present in Paul’s home growing up — from Weather Report and Crosby, Stills & Nash to Bobby Womack and Malian musician **Ali Farka Touré**.

The 2002 documentary *A Visit to Ali Farka Touré* captures the artist later in life, focusing on his humanitarian efforts in Mali and how his work increasingly centred on improving living conditions rather than recording and touring.

Touré’s commitment to community and place offers a powerful example of how artistic purpose can evolve beyond commercial output.

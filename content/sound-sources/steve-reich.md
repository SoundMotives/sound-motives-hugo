Kenton Slash Demon’s approach to sampling and repetition draws from a lineage that includes **Daft Punk**, **J Dilla**, and **Madlib**, but the idea of slowly modulating looping material traces directly back to **Steve Reich**.

As early as the 1960s, Reich was experimenting with tape loops, phasing, and repetition. He later applied similar principles to live instrumentation, allowing performers to drift gradually in and out of sync, creating complex rhythmic interactions.

> “If you were to subtract Steve Reich from the total sum of today’s musical culture, I think you’d notice more of a difference than if you took away any other single figure.”
— Tom Service, *The Guardian*

His influence on contemporary electronic and experimental music is difficult to overstate.

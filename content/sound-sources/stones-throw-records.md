After graduating from university, Paul moved back to London and began teaching music production at CM Sounds. During this period he became deeply influenced by the work of **Madlib**, whose releases on **Stones Throw Records** were a major inspiration.

Founded by Peanut Butter Wolf, Stones Throw developed a distinctive catalogue rooted in hip-hop, soul, jazz, and experimentation. The 2013 documentary *Our Vinyl Weighs a Ton* chronicles the label’s history and cultural impact.

Madlib’s 2013 *Medicine Show* appearance in London further reinforced the label’s importance to Paul’s artistic outlook.

Growing up in Michigan, Zach Shigeto initially dreamed of becoming a professional jazz musician. A number of seminal jazz records formed the foundation of his musical education, including works by **Pharoah Sanders**, **Miles Davis**, **Bill Evans**, and **Herbie Hancock**.

Among these, **John Coltrane’s *A Love Supreme*** stood apart. Recorded in late 1964 and released on Impulse! Records in 1965, the album’s spiritual intensity and rhythmic depth left a lasting impression on Shigeto’s approach to music — both as a drummer and later as a producer.

Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986) was born in Madanapalle, India, and was raised under the belief that he would become a world spiritual teacher.

In 1929, he publicly rejected this role, dissolved the organisation created around him, and returned all donated property and funds. From then on, he spent nearly sixty years travelling internationally, speaking to large audiences about freedom, self-inquiry, and radical personal change.

His uncompromising approach to truth and awareness has influenced artists, thinkers, and creatives seeking clarity beyond doctrine.

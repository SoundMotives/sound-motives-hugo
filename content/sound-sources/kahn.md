Mala cites contemporary Bristol producer **Kahn (Joseph McGann)** as a current influence. Kahn’s work spans dubstep, grime, and reggae/digital styles through projects including **Kahn & Neek**, **Bandulu Records**, and **Gorgon Sound**, and he is part of the **Young Echo Collective**.

Kahn exemplifies Mala’s interest in artists who blend historical knowledge of bass music with fresh, authentic production.

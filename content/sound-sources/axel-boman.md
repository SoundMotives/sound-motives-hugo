**Axel Boman** is a Swedish electronic music producer whose remixes of Kenton Slash Demon’s *Daemon* in 2010 proved particularly influential.

Both remixes were sparse, evolving, and hypnotic, showcasing Boman’s ability to create tension and movement with minimal elements. While known for club-ready releases, it is his more experimental work that most strongly resonated with Kenton Slash Demon.

Recent remixes for **John Talabot** and **Maribou State**, as well as his original work on **DJ Koze’s Pampa Records**, continue to expand his sonic palette.

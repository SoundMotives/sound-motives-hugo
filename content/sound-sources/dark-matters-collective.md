**Dark Matters** are a visual collective who collaborated closely with Kenton Slash Demon on the *Schwarzschild Trilogy* of EPs.

As referenced in Episode 3, both the graphic designers and videographers involved in the project played a formative role in shaping the direction of the music itself, not merely its presentation.

Dark Matters have since worked with artists such as **Den Sorte Skole** and **Trentemøller**, often focusing on light projection and installation work — meaning that visuals which appear digitally generated are frequently physical, real-world constructions.

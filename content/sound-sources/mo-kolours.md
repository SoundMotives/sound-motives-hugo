Paul has long shared an affinity with the South London label **22a**, and for good reason — he has been close friends with members of the collective for over a decade.

One of those artists is **Joe ‘Mo Kolours’**, whose work Paul has greatly admired. Over the years, both producers have encouraged and motivated each other creatively, developing parallel approaches rooted in groove, texture, and intuition.

Earlier in his career, Paul’s creative process was largely solitary — producing beats remotely for MCs. More recently, he began collaborating directly with musicians in shared studio spaces.

One of those early face-to-face collaborations was with **Jamie Woon** on the track *Thunder* from Woon’s 2015 album *Making Time*.

These sessions helped Paul develop new approaches to songwriting, lyrics, and collective creativity, highlighting the power of working closely with others.

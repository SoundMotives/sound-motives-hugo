Arriving at university in Nottingham, Max was introduced to drum & bass at the legendary **Marcus Garvey Centre**. It was his first experience of the genre in a club context.

Artists such as **Mickey Finn** and **Aphrodite**, along with labels like **RAM Records**, retained some of the aesthetic qualities Max loved in rave culture while introducing a new level of rhythmic complexity.

Acts such as **Ed Rush & Optical** became particularly influential during this period.

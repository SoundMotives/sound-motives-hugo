A musician Max cites as setting the benchmark for beautiful electronic music is **Lusine**. Originally from Texas and later based in Seattle, Lusine has been releasing music since the early 1990s and has remained consistently prolific.

In recent years, he has also worked on film soundtracks, reinforcing the connection between electronic music and visual storytelling.

Max first encountered Lusine’s track *Jetstream* through a LuckyMe mixtape by **Claude Speeed**, only realising its identity years later while preparing this episode.

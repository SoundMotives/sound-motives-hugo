Growing up in Northern Ireland, the first electronic music Max encountered came via the late-1980s synth-pop movement. His sister was a fan of **Depeche Mode** and Erasure, and their records provided an early gateway into electronic sound.

This exposure laid the groundwork for Max’s later interest in electronic music as an emotional and expressive medium, rather than purely functional club music.

Shigeto moved east to attend college at **The New School** in New York, where he continued developing as a jazz drummer.

During this time, one of his biggest influences was **Brian Blade**, particularly Blade’s 1998 album *Fellowship* and the track *Folklore*. Blade’s expressive, musical approach to drumming — prioritising feel, restraint, and emotional communication — had a profound impact on Shigeto’s playing.

Brian Blade continues to lead the Fellowship while also collaborating with artists such as **Joni Mitchell**, **Bob Dylan**, and **Wayne Shorter**.

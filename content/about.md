Sound Motives is a long-form audio series exploring the musical influences that shape today’s most interesting artists.

Rather than focusing on releases or career milestones, each episode traces the deeper listening habits that sit behind an artist’s work — the records, scenes, sounds, and moments that helped form their creative perspective.

Guests are invited to reflect on the music that mattered to them at different points in their lives: formative records, pivotal cultural movements, and the sounds that continue to inform how they make music today.

Episodes move freely between genres and eras — from jazz and classical to jungle, dubstep, ambient, and electronic music — with an emphasis on curiosity, context, and personal storytelling.

Sound Motives is about listening more closely: to music, to process, and to the often unseen influences that connect artists across generations.
